// streamAnim is designed to be a lower level image streaming utility
// to XWindows platforms including Linux with a minimal windowing and
// library need.  streamAnim never completely loads the stream of
// images into memory, only loading one image at a time.  This is
// exceptionaly useful with very large images and very large streams
// of images which can rapidly bring a systems memory grinding to a
// halt in mid animation.....
//
// streamAnim is not designed to be a converter or "stream" media to
// the Internet.  Rather, it is designed to simply and quickly parse
// image files and display them as fast as your own file system will
// deliver them while using as minimal a memory footprint as possible.
//
// This version relies on imlib for greater flexibility in image
// format loading....

// show all the files once through

streamAnim allmyfiles*.png

//
// loop continuously through the entire file set...
//
streamAnim --loop  allmyfiles*.png

// read the images files from file named myList with one imagefile per line..
// loop continuously through the entire file set...
//
streamAnim --loop --listFile myList



// If you pass a myList file to streamAnim, it will parse a file name,
// then attempt to load it from:
//
// the filename itself
// the current directory prefixed to the filename
// the root of the myList file added to the filename
//
// if none are possible, the file will be dropped/ignored.
